# SQL_Capstone_Project
In Capstone Project, I demonstrated expertise in structuring and querying complex datasets related to airline operations. I designed and implemented a comprehensive database to manage key aspects such as booking details, passenger information, flight schedules, and aircraft data, ensuring data consistency and scalability. Using advanced SQL techniques like Joins, Subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Window Functions, I developed efficient queries to extract actionable insights and enhance operational decision-making. 
Key achievements included optimizing flight schedules, analyzing passenger trends, and improving booking management through meticulous data analysis. I applied performance tuning techniques to ensure query efficiency and implemented secure access controls to safeguard sensitive information. My approach integrated advanced date formatting and analysis to support time-sensitive operations.
This project highlighted my ability to manage and analyze large-scale datasets, aligning data insights with business goals to improve overall efficiency and customer satisfaction. It set the foundation for leveraging data-driven strategies in the aviation industry.
